******************************PMR********************************
<+s> I absolutely love merge sort algorithm, as its divide-and-conquer
    approach amazes me with its efficiency. Needless to say,
    I finished this project relatively quick.

In the future: I will catch up to the current schedule then go
                    back and finish the assignments I have skipped.
