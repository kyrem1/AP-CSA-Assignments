******************************PMR********************************
<+s> I was able to reuse code from the previous 3 assignments
        making the coding of this project fairly straightforward.

<-s> I got tired and used random numbers to initialize the items array
        but it doesn't have any significant impact on the overall
        implementation so don't worry about it.

*****************************************************************
In the future: I will catch up to the current schedule then go
                    back and finish the assignments I have skipped.
