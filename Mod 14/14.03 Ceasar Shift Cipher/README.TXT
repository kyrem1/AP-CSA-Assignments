******************************PMR********************************
<+s> I made this project on my desktop with IntelliJ IDE, and
    I actually had a good amount of fun with it. I had to read
    the Java API a good amount but overall this was a relatively straightforward,
    yet slightly less trivial project.
    

<-s> I may have made it a bit too complicated by using character
    arrays, but it still works.

In the future: I will catch up to the pacing guide.
