PROJECT TITLE: 16.04 / Candidate.java && ElectionTesterV5.java && ElectionTesterV6.java && ElectionTesterV7.java && ElectionTesterV8.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project explores use of insertion and deletion algorithms and the differences between their
                      implementations for Arrays vs. ArrayLists.

******************************PMR********************************
<+s> I was able to figure out the trick to these algorithms relatively
        quickly.

<-s> I originally though that we had to expand the array (for
        the insertion algorithms) by assigning it to a new array
        of greater size, but then realized that this was not
        the task and completed the actual task correctly.

*****************************************************************
In the future: I will go back and finish the assignments I have skipped.
